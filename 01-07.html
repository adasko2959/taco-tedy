      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I'm in a threesome, red wine and bru
      Pretty cool, makes me know I'm an animal are you?
      I've got scars on my brain and some bleeding occured
      Some freaking holes in my veins just from breathing 
      this world In, looking around, didn't see any truth
      It may be blocked by the neons, cannot see art
      All I'm seeing is shoes and jewels and other things
      'Cause the marketing kings know the way to stop peons
      Go shop peons, 3D TV, the lead brand
      Win a trip to the Carribeans, so you can
      Smoke in the sand, feel like a poetic man
      Your life is boring and bland, so why not dream on?
      Wasting your time - does it not seem wrong?
      Watch a man smile, guess what kind of crack he's on
      Why is that homeless guy rambling on?
      Why do my friends huff gasoline, huh?
      Why do we eat pigs, but kittens we pamper and love?
      Why do our leaders don't speak for us
      Treat foreign lands with a bomb
      We give them a second term, like it wasn't a problem
      Our fake enemies have pride, so we're happy to rob them of it
      Our information in the Web's stomach
      I'm waiting 'till it vomits and I bet the fucking feds love it
      I'm just trying to grasp the sense of it
      To the inventors of beer, wine and weed, you got my thanks for it
      They're in a threesome in my lungs and stomach
      My body will hate me tomorrow, but right now it's euphoric
      And you're just waiting for the chorus to hit
      You're 'bout to get horribly pissed 'cause it doesn't exist
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      Redwinebeer, redwinebeer, redwinebeer...
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      I'm in a threesome, with my nemesis and his mistress
      What the hell is my plan? None of your business
      Fuck the rich kids, I'm running with misfits
      Try to use my brain, the motherfucker's, telling me it's his
      I'm outta here, message received
      The best medicine fed with impressive technique
      Strutting around like Socrates with lessons to teach
      Why won't the city notice me? I'm a cellophane creep
      Heart beats while the melody's bleak
      My mind is a poem, I'm an elegant freak, you know it
      Roaming the streets, not known to preach
      Pastors, psychics and priests, they are phony to me
      My love story - what's it going to be?
      I kneel before the drums like Juliette at Romeo's feet
      Asking myself what is my road and where's it going to lead
      I want money, cash, fame, though it's horribly cheap
      But, as you know, Fate's a comedienne
      Goddamn, why can't Fate be obedient?
      Listen, Fate, please stop killing my friends
      Life's a movie, too bad you will never see it again
