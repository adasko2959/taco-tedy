      <b>[Intro]</b>
      Fighting and making this repeated again and again
      Until most of the females are pregnant and the males are exhausted
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Taco
      Mind hairy, money tall as fuck. Call me Chewbacca
      I don't want to listen any Chuck, give me some Waka
      „JFK" kind of flopped, I blame it on Jimmy Hoffa
      It’s a race, I'm a big fat rat like Mickey's poppa
      Fuck the race, I’ve been in the back. Sharpen the teeth. I'm skinning you cats
      Running the game, going up in the chain and I will harassing your bitches in fact
      H.E.M.I.N.G.W. A.Y, is that fucking dude bugging you, huh?
      Mr. Hemingway coming through, ugh. Earning my bucks, who the fuck are you
      Rolling me in Bohan, going bowling with Roman
      Bellic it's getting hectic but, check it, I come from Poland
      I'm blowing up in London, there's only one thing that I'm hoping
      I wanna get a fucking feature from Sweden, shout-outs to Young Lean
      Shout-outs to Pauline, uhm, I was just wondering
      If you wanna get married, „goddamn it, Filip, you're drunk again"
      Wake up next day, head broke again. Trying to roll a cigarette, man, fuck the wind
      No cash, cause I spent most of it. Was it even worth it, man, it must've been
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      I'm Chewbacca. Crossbow, top shotta
      I'm Chewbacca on these bombaclots (Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu)
      I'm Chewbaca. Crossbow at the copper
      What am I doing? I just drank a lot
      I'm screaming: (Ooh)
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      I'm Chewie, see, put the Louie in Louis V
      And I'm saying shout-outs to C.K, he's saying like „who is he"?
      When I was seventeen on a rooftop in BK, I truly dreamed
      Of becoming a freaking MC, I'm rapping now, holy shit
      These rappers annoying
      Me and the mic, like Chandler and Joey
      Look at my balls, they're dangling, boy
      I'm marrying Perry and strangling Zoey
      You fuckers are cute
      Feeling like Biggie so gimme the loot
      Fuck all your parties and popping the mollies
      My mommy just brought up some broccoli soup
      All you blind fucks is Mrs Patmore
      Peep this, how 'bout you tweet less and rap more
      Jeez. If I was rich like Croesus and Macklemore
      I think that I would buy me a dream at Yeezy's rap store
      Maybe like a bottle of wine
      Or two, three, four, you know I think a dozen is fine
      A pack of cigarettes, you know I haven't smoked for some time
      I got a message from a fan, fuck it, I'm not replying
      You know why? 'I'm a diva. Fuck rap, playing FIFA
      I do a show fuck off to Tenerifa
      All you fuckers eat your hearts out like Khaleesi's beef
      I plant the seed in the game like I harvest Amber Khalifa

      <b>[Refren]</b>
      Nah, I'm Chewbacca. Crossbow, top shotta
      I'm Chewbacca on these bombaclots (Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu)
      I'm Chewbaca. Crossbow at the copper
      What am I doing? I just drank a lot
      I'm screaming: (Ooh)
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you!
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you!
      Goddamn. You motherfucker, you!
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 3]</b>
      Drink something and I'm a Wookie
      Only though my only mixtape flopped, I'm not a rookie
      I can almost hear hateful your thoughts like I was Sookie
      Do a Vik, bet the dead guy will win, go call your bookie
      Earl flow, and the lips kinda fat, I'm not as ugly
      Face always IDGAF, like I was Droopy
      Stole the thunder, got banned, got back I got a new key
      'Finna start a fucking cool ass cult, like Captain Murphy
      Taco Hems, go and run tell your friends, I'm out-this-worldly
      Cancerous, like the Lump is my Kin, shout out to Lurleen
      Are you late for the Sweatshirt wagon? Well, I'm kind of Early
      But I bet it's gonna be full soon, you better hurry
      Young Hems, known for lung flex
      Rhymes bursting out compulsive like writing a dumb text
      I will break your self-esteem after breaking your chums' necks
      Show up at your show drunk and befriending your mum's ex, Taco

      <b>[Outro]</b>
      You motherfucker, you!
      You motherfucker, you!
      You motherfucker, you!
