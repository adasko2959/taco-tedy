      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Alright
      It's Childish Gambino, can't forget me like I'm Rosebud
      Drop unexpected and improper like some nose-blood
      Take a drum, take a fucking slut, fuck'em both up
      Taking reign all over your land, 'cause the flow's mud
      
      Drinking in the kitchen, roast cunts while I toast fun
      Swing my nuts 'round a haunted home, making ghosts come
      Can't stop chugging beers, well, I guess it's one of those months
      Educated rap, no F-n-Deez, call'em THOSE nuts
      
      Far as salaries go
      I'm like a gay Luigi with'em, try to marry the O's
      Hugging my bros, getting too drunk, carry me home
      I can't remember where it is, it's either Paris or Rome
      
      I'm in the hotseat and I love it, gonna marry the throne
      Your singing voice, Y Soprano? Leave it after the tone
      I love it though, it's an homage, H is silent, you know
      Your style is heroin, so drop the H from champ and be blown
      (Uh uh ah uh, uh uh)
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      You rappers impotent and illeterate, zero Ball-zack
      Calling God a cunt, I'm not surprised when no one calls back
      Told me I can't fuck with this shit, let me pause that
      Mind is getting paradoxical like a lost map
      
      Load your fucking GPS, head battling sleepiness
      Bible should named be „Shit My GOD Says", CBS
      Do he mean „BS", about the things our Lord Jesus says?
      You're mad, while I'm like a loyal Mexican, won't see mistress
      
      See the fence, fucking cleaning sucks, watch me leave a mess
      Try to clean your fucking daughter's chest and her creamy breast
      Your defense on the thin side, mine is really dense
      Lyrics criminal, so I guess I'll make the beat confess
      
      Reinhold, Judy, Apatow, damn it, are you happy now?
      Open a Pandora can of pop-culture, make Andy proud
      Wait until you here the CAMP-bells, when it comes to town
      Sober now, making vodka scream, making Sake howl
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 3]</b>
      Chilling with my Enrons. Say it like a white-collar
      Fuck green, got a black wallet, making white dollars
      If I never take a break, fuck it, why should I bother?
      We used to play all the time, dude, Nightcrawler
      
      Drinking all across the fucking country, we're party folk
      Last night we were pretty wealthy kids, now we're nasty broke
      Eyes around the head, Voldemort, we are hardly stoked
      Always one step ahead of you mosters, Gary Oak
      
      Females always touching on my nuts, like they're Pokeballs
      Hope she knows it's no strings attached like a broke guitar
      Ladies want to get close with me, fellas hope he's far
      Told me I'm not fit, 'cause the D.I.D, but I know we are
      Marilyn sex-appeal with Kennedy hair
      I'm on tour, Dallas-Los Angeles, you better beware
      I blast competition, blue shells, I'll never be fair
      My two cents are worth fucking millions, my pennies are rare
