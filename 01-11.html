      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Making Alpha Males obsolete like Betamax
      I'm stating facts, coming for your brain, I'll break it fast
      They said I have less than 5 seconds, I'll make'em last
      Though Chronos is an asshole
      I'll work while he's taking naps
      Wait for Zeus to lose temper
      Make him turn my enemies to a stash of loose members
      Then become God of Gods, Mammals and Birds
      And all the girls will feed me grapes
      While I'm throwing a curse
      Date Aphrodite, make her my wifey
      Fuck her twice, then i leave
      To fight the God of the Vikings
      I'm the God of the Fight
      I'm the God of the Light
      God of the Night, God of the Fire
      And God of the Tide
      And you're a, target I strike, when my claws start
      Straving for fights, my heart's bright, jaw's barking with might (Raf raf)
      'Cause life is tough, tough
      It's not a bluff, poor schmuck
      I am fucking you up
      Reduce you to a newborn
      Leave you stucking two thumbs
      Make you regret every single of
      The troubles you've brung
      Me, Guess it's kinda funny
      It's a world where a king is a violent dummy
      Piles of shit next to piles of money
      Being almighty is alright
      But it's too motherflipping hard for me
      The world is turning
      You should stop running
      It would be a smart place
      If the fools would stop cumming
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Stop the run and have some fun
      Stop the race at once, 'cause the rats are wrong
      They run in circles, all the laps they've done
      Still ended up in square one, while us cats are gone
      The things you own, are a trap, my son
      Like Huxley thought - we're slaves to the stuff we bought
      The crap we own, trust me mob, cast your stone
      But i refuse to cast a vote, I attack the thone
      Spineless, lack you lack some bones
      Why don't you show your true face, leave the mask at home
      You worship cash and attack the poets
      I'll smash opponents in half, fucking trash you rodents
      Fucking trash you rats and throw you high
      Spinning like a fucking acrobat
      I gotta do it, make you bastards clap
      Fuck politeness, no one is ever asked to rap
      And that's that
