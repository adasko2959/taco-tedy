      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Alright, simpletons, I will simple it up
      For all you fellas who are clueless, but who still give a fuck
      This wasn't written for the schmucks and the businessmen punks
      And all you blunt-twisting rappers who ain't thinking enough
      Your gibberish is horrific, are you spitting in tongues?
      You bleak fucks shouldn't speak, you're not vivid enough
      Asked for truth, but all you could give was a bluff
      So I'll be blunt now, I want unlimited love
      Unlimited trust, a flow that's explicit enough
      To bust your jaw in tiny pieces, leave it blistered with blood
      I don't get your rituals, I was christened with mud
      I'm a fatalist whose life is just riddled with luck
      That's why I, sin so much, drink my gin so much
      While my friends want to pretend they haven't been through much
      Please belive me when i tell you that this isn't boast
      And when I raise my glass remember that it isn't a toast
      'Cause I don't care about you it's horrific, I know
      But in this dance called life people pivot alone
      And all the issues that you push are a Sisyphus' stone
      You're like dogs praying to god to give you a bone
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      The truth is simple, we do not know what to do anymore
      Because our legendary heaven isn't blue anymore
      My life is ripped to pieces, it was fluent before!
      I only know it's all the wars that are confusing me more
      I'm living in a place where freaks, thugs, Judases roam
      Looked around and couldn't tell you who is whom anymore
      I've seen the pearly gates, they're just a ludicrous door
      And so I drown all of you motherfucking puristsin porn
      I'm, double evil, stormtrooper with horns
      And double nasty, I'm fucking one of Lucipher's whores
      A tragedy has happened indeed, computerized souls
      None of which seems to be able much to neutralize war
      So, how about you get us euthanized, Lord?
      Oh, I guess that's what all the tsunamis are for, huh?
      Life isn't brutal, it's the gruesomest gore
      Peace nonexistant like the arrow of a Cupid in pornos
      Go ahead, harvest me, you fucking leech
      That's a different speech, pardon me
      All your religions are a farce to me
      Don't let no gods write no motherfucking laws for me

      <b>[Zwrotka 3]</b>
      I don't hate your guts, I love'em, I'm like a cannibal
      When it comes to your guts I'm a carnivore animal
      I really love humanity like Shady loves valium
      And tylenol and in spite of all, I'm proud of you
      But i just want to wake up, see a world where science rules
      The Gods are forsaken being labeled as violent fools
      And the priests stop lying to you
      You think I'm the liar, though, and the rival to you (Rrah)
      Pace yourself, don't pray for help
      Find a way to help yourself, find a way to step
      On your own, watch the throne, don't obey no men
      Don't stay within your own power, let your greatness spread
      Keep your paranoia watered and fed
      Or they'll destory your fucking head
      Leave you slaughtered and dead
      Be, a good man and then Karma's your friend
      But in the end you will adpot that fucking scar on your head
      'Cause it's inevitable, and remember there's a devil in you
      Sounds like a like a lie, I can tell you it's true
      Every day, tries to fuck your brain, make you insane
      Let him, Just for the hell of it, dude
