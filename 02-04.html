      <b>[Intro]</b>
      Goddamn it, now (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now, My name isn't Taco, you know, my name is Filip
      
      <b>[Verse 1]</b>
      Sitting on a porch chair, today I just don't care
      Grab my friend's phone, „hey, do you have any porn there?"
      Overheard by female passerbys, there goes that long stare
      Fuck ya'll bitches and glowing hair
      Fuck your shoes and your gear, pierced boobs and your ears
      Fuck your blues and your chop'n'screws and your rocking rolls
      My genre is indie-folk-low-fi-post-weird
      I'm beloved and ignored, most loved and most feared
      I'm a white European boy, best believe it boy
      So much „weird" in my lyrics that I'll never be employed
      Latest ploy, rape Freud with a phallic-shaped toy
      Ask him for analysis, while my phallus is showing
      Never been rich or piss-poor. Is it wrong?
      Always low self-esteem, like „what'd I get that kiss for?"
      And then my ego exploded, (Boom, boom) explode
      Suddenly feeling like God when he's blowing his load
      On the face of his favorite pope, screaming: „baby choke"
      Then he's sucking on a blunt laced with his favorite dope
      Screaming, quote: „Fuck Africa. I'm gonna leave'em broke
      Whole world is a pile of fucking dirt, semen soaked"
      (Goddamnit, now)
      Oh, yes indeed. Funny how he never say these things in press release
      I'm hungry. Not rap-wise, hungry for Lebanese
      And instead saying grace, I will be resting in peace, (goddamn it now)
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      Goddamn it now
      I just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now
      Gimme me a trampoline, give me a tambourin
      Red wine, blueberries and a gram of green, (goddamn it now)
      Goddamn it now
      I just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now
      Gimme me a trampoline and a tambourin
      Red wine blueberries and a gram of green (Uuh)
      Goddamn it, now
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Young Hems, what the dealy?
      My name isn't Taco, you know, my name is Filip
      And I'm from a town that's been burned to the ground
      That's why I'm never down, 'less you stab my achilles
      I think I'm Big Meech and Bronsonelli
      Fuck the crowd in the mouth, get your tonsils ready
      I'm rocking Wilma's bed and locking jaws with Betty
      I'm 'bout to spit the vomit on y'all. Mom's spaghetti
      Invited to Biggie's house and his parties are heavy
      I tried to carpool but I couldn't get my balls in the Chevy
      I got there late but I still shook some hands and got me a bevy
      And Biggie's asking me why I'm no longer rapping as FV (Goddamn now)
      Because of Hopsin, I told him
      Now I rapping with a name from FIFA manager mode
      Oh, and I'm a Yiddo. Hungry like a hippo
      Keep your lips closed, kid or I'll damage your folks
      Party on, yeah, the bitches were big fun
      But I'm in the kitchen eating freaking chicken with Big Pun
      He wants the last piece, he's licking his damn teeth
      I'm saying like „aight, peace", but I grab it and make a run
      „Son, I beg your pardon!"
      When I'm hungry I got Bronson fronting steak with garlic
      Then we're having fondue or whatever you call it
      I woke up in my apartment, a half-dead alcoholic ( uuh)

      <b>[Bridge]</b>
      Goddamn it, now, (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now, (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      Goddamn it now
      I just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now
      Gimme me a trampoline, give me a tambourin
      Red wine, blueberries and a gram of green, (goddamn it now)
      Goddamn it now
      I just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now
      Gimme me a trampoline and a tambourin
      Red wine blueberries and a gram of green (Uuh)
      
      <b>[Outro]</b>
      Goddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      Goddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)
      And I'm from a town that's been burned to the ground
      That's why I'm never down, 'less you stab my achilles
