      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Young Hems is the name, you see
      I flow vicious and chaotic like your veins on speed
      I'm like your brain on E, acid, cocaine and weed
      Classy, mundane, indeed. I got a couple personalities so stay with me
      If you're not liking what you're hearing I can change the scheme
      And I can change the beat, like:
      My girl pretty, my grades average
      Saying: fuck the city, cause I am a savage
      Cutting bruises in my brain so I get the smartness
      But I went too far, man, just get the bandage
      I need booze. A few sips help the sadness
      Switch quicker than the motherfucking trends in Paris
      I'm both the Agent Harrises and the Tony Sopranoses
      Cue a Rap Genius nerd with some boring analysis
      I'm the Gangeses and red wines flowing in palaces
      I'm the millionth rapper saying how fucking evil and bad he is
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      That's boring
      Claiming you're a fucking demon? (That's boring)
      Saying you spray chicks with semen? (That's boring)
      Crying we should respect the females? (So boring)
      Bragging 'bout your car and your nine? (That's boring)
      Complaining about rapping 'bout dimes? (That's boring)
      Rap purists go back to '95, go see Pac 
      touring and go suck on his crack pipe
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      I see. You fuckers are feisty
      Cause I'm on my Ricky Ross, you're mad cause I'm icy
      I wanna calm the fuck down, and light up a nice tree
      But my own mind is going against me, like why me?
      I guess I'm the rap game's Balotelli
      All these big black Tobiases? I call'em Nelly
      Got Halle B sucking my D, don't swallow, Berry-
      My seed's precious. If you do it I am carving your belly
      All I do is fucking rap, and I'm not charging a penny
      You say you got bars, true, but it's not many
      I fuck your clique up, stab Carl, rob Lenny
      Then sip a Duff, watch some fucking Scrubs on the telly
      I spit that red hot fat fire Bronsonelli
      Slick white boy look, Tommy Carcetti
      But I got the Omar brain, plus I got the Pollack flame
      Priest Robak shame, really sonny you are not ready
      Shots heavy. It's Friday, I'm on my Sobotka
      Old Polish fuck, chugging beers, eating a babka
      Then I'm cruising 'round the city with a bottle of vodka
      And a pretty young doll, but I'm calling her Lalka
      Like I'm motherfucking Prus, but my mózg is Kafka
      And my music is red fuzzy, too, I'm Rothko
      Cigarettes - I'm off those, I'm swimming in booze
      I ain't got shit to lose, so I'm boasting I got flows

      <b>[Refren]</b>
      (That's boring)
      Comparing your flows to rivers? (That's boring)
      Love songs, like "her hips quiver"? (That's boring)
      Still rhyming the words "nigga" and "trigger"? (That's boring)
      Bragging 'bout your bling and look? (That's boring)
      Shallow melodies on every hook?
      Rap purists go back to '96, go compete with 
      Lil' Kim over rights to Frank's dick
      
      <b>[Outro]</b>
      Pac, Big L, Biggie
      Proof, Big Pun, Eazy
      Pimp C, ODB
      Ey, ey, ey
      Pac, Big L, Biggie
      Proof, Big Pun, Eazy
      Pimp C, ODB
      That's boring
      That's boring
      Pam, pom, pam, pom, pam, pam, pom 
      That's boring
