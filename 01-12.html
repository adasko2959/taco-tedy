      <b>[Intro]</b>
      Who you think I am?
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Why don't you tell me who you're supposed to be
      'Cause you're a pair of fake tits on a ghost to me
      You aren't even half-real but most of you freaks
      Seem to be holding a belief that you were chosen to be
      The Messiah, huh, a bunch of mice and liars
      I'll confront you silly guys, set your wives on fire
      You're not who you think you are
      You're not rebels and fighters
      But you're still exposing me
      To your irrelevant IQ's
      Fake fucks, see American Idol, I would
      Much rather leave and ride to hell on a bike, fool
      Those people should be charged like felons and iced, too
      I'm not harsh, maybe the devil's a nice dude
      My rhymes, they're not medicine, mind you
      They can heal your soul, but they can tear it apart, too
      I'm a motherfucking liar, but I hate being lied to
      I'm a hypocrite, shit, I'm a hellish disciple
      I'm not an idol, I'm merely a guy who
      Keeps track of his own thoughts
      Man, I'm letting my mind move
      If I don't succeed, brother, fuck your needs
      Fuck the world, fuck the kids, fuck the girls
      I'm getting mad now, something struck my nerves
      Looks like I gotta calm down, puff some herb
      Listen, head, you're out of luck, you heard?
      Heart turned to the brain said: „Fuck you neeeeeeerd" (Yeeah)
      'Cause it's not your turn, so act
      Like a damned soul, brother, drop and burn
      Some things just never change
      Like they're rocking a perm
      And this is just one of the lessons
      You've forgotten to learn
      I got some news:
      If you follow the herd
      Usually the case is
      You abolish your views, you see
      If what I'm saying is appalling to you, it's okay
      Just have some decency, don't call me a fool, you freak
      Hate spewed with a horrible tone
      But I will never listen to it, I'm immortal in stone
      Because I am still growing strong, like my horrible poems
      So bring the fire, baby boy, I gotta roast the opponents (Yeah)
      You keep knocking on the wrong address
      Like the Jehovah boy saying that his God's the best
      Mick, jaggering me, Can't you hear me knocking?
      I don't give a fuck and the whole village is talking
      I'm mine, not your somebody
      3 o'clock, get your books, go home and study
      Be a man, get a job, bring home the money
      I don't want your lifestyle, 'cause you folks are lonely
      And mostly phony and most of you don't even know me
      So go teach somebody else about this false baloney
      You're forcing on me
      I'mma pause your boring monologues
      'Cause, oh my god, I am grossly stunning
      Fake tits on ghosts, yet awfully boring
      Take a lookie here, I even look awesomely yawning
      You call yourself the boss quite a lot
      But i would like you stop
      You're like Michael Scott
      But not even funny
