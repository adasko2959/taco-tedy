      <b>[Intro]</b>
      A big part of the problem we face today is that our children 
      have been taught in schools that every idea is right (...) 
      And what do we call that? They call it multiculturalism. 
      And it has paralyzed too many of our fellow citizens to make 
      the critical judgement we need to make to prosper as a society
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I'm genocidal on this 22, I'm Rwanda
      I'm a dude both Hutus and Tutsis are not fond of
      Lazy for days, work nights, Mary Jane Fonda
      You're in a line-up doing lines, while I do conga
      You want beef, burger, flipper get devoured like food
      I'm a retarded evil genius using powers for good
      A sip of brew when I wake up, then a Xanax at noon
      I'm on some Drizzy-Drake shit, singing out of the blue
      Means I'm singing in the rain
      So, goddamn it, Sam, play it, Frank, sing it again
      When I was seventeen I used to pour my seed down the drain
      Creating sewage monsters, sorry Dufresne (My bad)
      You'll never make it through the damn canal
      See, I'm a fucking Heisenberg, and you brats a Hal
      Your style's foul and a tad banal
      I am a walking mystery like I'm femme fatal
      The good and evil in me cancel out
      A rough gentleman, I cum into damsel's mouth
      I'm dangerous like sitting down in Chris Hansen's house
      The new thing on the radio, I'm throwing Lazlow out
      Checking in, sipping gin, plenty brew and plenty doubt
      I gotta finish, 'cause it's twenty two, I'm checking out
      I'm not a terrorist...(Get outta, get outta, get outta here)
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Gotta go back, man, fuck a convention
      I vomit with all the stuff that you suckers mention
      Yeah, yeah, typical message, not enough attention
      Every rapper thinks he's Biggie, Slim, L, Hova and then some
      Throw me in jail, leave in a cell for nights
      'cause I don't like your God's work, go to hell with pride
      Don't understand me, not the Mensa type
      Your gun's heavy, well, my pencil's light, End of fight
      
      <b>[Outro]</b>
      Yep, why, wow, c'mon, just..., this is, this is, well, 
      (Go home, go home!)
      This is the worst crowd that I've ever... I'm not gonna...
      (Go home, traitor! traitor! Go home)
      I can't go home, I've been paid by the club to... 
      (Go home, go home, Terrorist!, Go home you terrorist!)
      I'm not the terrorist! How the fuck am I a terrorist, tho?!
      (Go home, home)
      Oh, you kiss that retarded ass with that mouth?
      Jeez... (Go home!)
