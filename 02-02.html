      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Filip in this bitch like a hound barking super fast
      Smoke rising up to the lungs from a hookah glass
      Left hand, Red Stripe, like the 'Murican flag
      Jacking the White out of your sight, making you super sad
      Stranger than a nun who decided to wear skirts more
      Smell the microphone like the dome of my first born
      "Achy Breaky" Billy Ray, he told me I should twerk more
      Emcees running out of bars you better call the jerk store
      Or AT&T. Tell me your mates hate me
      It's making me fairly angry, like - really? - why would you say it to me
      I'm from Poland but the internet made me
      Teeth fucked, though I haven't smoked cigarettes lately
      This that new stuff, it sucks, let me bust a few
      Lady Luck, I'm just being blunt, got a crush on you
      Zero point seven per throat, just like the Russians do
      Polish people too, I'm like Tevez, very emotional
      Name's Filip. Last name unpronounceable
      Mentally ill, I'm thinking 'bout what would House do
      I do my own thing I bang some loud tunes
      Police banging at my door like I wasn't allowed to
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      I was just listening to "Marvin's Room"
      I was just listening to Arctic Monkeys
      I was just listening to DANGERDOOM
      But if you want, you can come in and fucking cuff me
      I was just listening to "Marvin's Room"
      I was just listening to Arctic Monkeys
      I was just listening to DANGERDOOM
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Words shooting out like midgets from cannons
      Shipping death, I'm on fire like I'm swimming for Stannis
      I hit the water to cool off, take your chick to Atlantis
      I ride some sea whores for a while, then I'm tickling salmons
      That was a pussy joke, I'm kind of embarrassed
      Rappers claiming they are Michael, fuck it, call me Maharis
      Ain't his first language, dude is rapping with mad talent
      Going hard at it, since he moved out of his dad's phallus, ugh
      Let me bring it down a bit
      Here I sit, couple buckets, 80 pounds of spit
      I should send it to the healers, even, better the dealers
      And I would measure it in liters but its kind of thick, you know.
      I'm a Valleyman, sucking on mangos
      Hemingway is that fucker always causing a scandal
      Anyway, then I motherfucking buck'em like Django
      Tell it straight, count two doors, then hop in the Lambo
      I'm a goddamn dirty Pollack
      Man I can't believe I'm drinking freaking coca cola
      Went to Paris, that's the only reason Lisa is Mona
      I drank red, then I passed out on the street corner
      Woke up in London just to get my diploma
      Actual Master of Science on THIS microphone
      I'm back home play just to bump some fucking Kendrick, hol'up
      Somebody's banging at my door, the neighbor's must've called up

      I was just listening to "Marvin's Room"
      I was just listening to Arctic Monkeys

      <b>[Outro]</b>
      - You didn't pull the trigger.
      - No I didn't. Somebody else did. 
        And I wound up in here. Bad luck, I guess.
        It floats around. It's got to land on somebody.
        It was my turn, that's all.
        I was in the path of the tornado.
