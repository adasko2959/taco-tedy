      <b>[Intro]</b>
      Fuck your couch, nigga!
      Buy another one you rich motherfucker!
      Fuck your couch, nigga, Fuck your couch!
      Darknesses! Darknesses!
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Sitting on the porch chair, today I just don't care
      Grab my friend's phone; „hey, do you have any porn there?"
      Overheard by female passerbys, there goes that long stare
      Fuck ya'll bitches and your glowing hair
      Fuck your shoes and your gear, pierced boobs and your ears
      Fuck your blues and your chop'n'screws and your rock'n'rolls
      My genre is indie-folk-low-fi-post-weird
      I'm beloved and ignored, most loved and most feared
      I'm a white European boy, best belive it boy
      So much weird in my lyrics that I'll never be employed
      Latest ploy - fuck Freud with a phallic-shaped toy
      Ask him for analysis, while my phallus is showing
      Never been rich or piss-poor, is it wrong?
      Always low self-esteem, like „what'd I get that kiss for?"
      Then my ego exploded, (boom, boom) explode
      Suddenly feeling like God when he's blowing his load
      On the face of his favourite Pope, screaming: „baby, choke!"
      Then he's sucking on a blunt, laced with his favourite dope
      Screaming quote: „Fuck Africa, I'm gonna leave them broke
      Whole world is a pile of fucking dirt, semen-soaked"
      Don't get mad at me, that's what God said
      Just grasp the fucking concept, ask a man if he's got bread
      Money is the tool of Satan plotting revenge
      I hope I convinced you, leave your money to me, then
      Leave your belongings and pretend
      That you're a grown man and you are using reason
      And if you think I'm lying and that I am thieving
      Just grab your fucking phone, man, and call the police then
      I'm a fucking walking God
      I don't care if you believe that my thoughts are fucking odd
      Actually, I'm proud of them, I'll go in the ground for them
      I guess that being smart is a lost fucking art
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      FV, food villain, call me Filip, call me Filip
      It's alright, you know, It's alright
      For the next minute, I can just slow that shit down
      
      <b>[Outro]</b>
      Spell so good, my pronoucing is awkward
      Feet go ahead, but my mind is running backwards
      Squeeze her head, she's like „ouch, that hurts''
      Throw my love away, take out the trash girl
      I'm an assturd, batard and rap nerd
      May lack love a bit but I never lack words
      There goes the blood, bring the morphine back, nurse
      Now I'm whispering ''Nevermore'' like the black bird
