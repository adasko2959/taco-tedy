      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I guess I blew up suddenly, just like the bromance flicks
      Now everybody's lining up to hear the Pollack spit
      'Cause I'm a rap-immigrant, with a flow as vicious
      As addiction, Barney Gumble sucking Duffman's dick
      Rejecting love, screaming fuck Paris
      Reject authority like Tony screaming fuck Harris
      Don't call me fat, I've had enough GLADoS
      And after what Aperture did, really fuck science
      This was a triumph, had enough trying
      When I explode you're gonna see some fucking trucks flying
      This is what I have in store, you are wishing to buy it
      I don't reveal my tricks, though like The Magician's alliance
      Got that long-ball-Jew Larry David flow
      Pretty, pretty good, you don't need to rate me, though
      'Cause I'm not ratable, what the hell you take me for?
      Need I say more? I reign supreme, BB, 1984
      Pay me more, give me a hand, rather than
      Telling me there is always money in the banana stand
      I nag a ram with the massivest anagram
      I'm madder than the Mad Hatter smoking the fattest gram
      I splatter them, like the evil young Padawan
      Named Anakin, betraying all the men who were proud of him
      Kenobi was his brother, but he ended up stabbing him
      Shit, I went off topic, I'll come back with a brag again
      Got balls like the Tatooine suns, my eyes red like the sword master Anakin swung
      I'll put a blaster in your mouth, then I'll blaster the fuck
      Out of your guts, leave you looking just like Jabba the Hut
      Father these rhymes like a mad cunt, dad of the month
      Say what you want about Anakin, but his parenting sucks
      It doesn't help his kids were, almost planning to fuck
      Until Solo came and showed, what the Falcon is up
      Big Lebowski and Charles Bukowski
      Are the reasons I'm not angry, when you call me Kowalski
      Motherfucker, you can't stop me, from tearing up Wall Street
      After I stop knocking I am, entering balls deep
      Fake fucks, Ralph Cifarettos
      I'd like to take you on a boat ride like Fredo
      Ask the Titanic people 'cause I bet they know
      If that motherfucking night water really is frosty
      Come to class, make it really embarrassing
      For the teacher when I laugh, 'cause he's preaching a fallacy
      Go ahead and plant a seed, see it reaching the tallest tree
      And so every time you speak your breathing a part of me
      But I didn't plant the seed, for you leaches to harvest me
      Now my words are getting sweet, they are squeezing my arteries
      And my inner lyricist, he is singing the harmony
      While my inner demon screams, but he seems like a part of me
      Yes, I'm mean, there's a reason I gotta be:
      'Cause it seems the happy people, had a freaking lobotomy
      I stay psychotic, like the freaking economy
      Just living. Not a single fuck given
     
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      A fuck given is a fuck wasted
      Hey kids, stop loving life and try to rape it
      A fuck given is a fuck wasted
      Hey kids, stop loving life and try to rape it
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Am I harsh? Oui, naturalment
      But I'm Christ reincarnated, I want back on the throne
      Now you wanna stab my heart, probably shoot at my home
      But I was just breaking your balls, man... Uff, maddon!
      A bad soul, Paulie Gualtieri
      I'm Thierry Henry's ghost, at an Irish cemetary
      I'm Jackie Kennedy and my style is legendary
      I impregnated Josephs wife, just don't tell'em Mary
      Just tell a lie, say it's God's, or a fricken Jedi's
      I realize, that I'm not going to heaven, am I?
      Uhm, gotta kiss my mental health goodbye
      And when I die, I am going straight to hell to fry
      Rhymes echo, collecting a death toll
      Like the retro God, before he was let go
      And the one in the New Testament was more gentle
      Gave the sword a break, introduced the pencil
      Still killed motherfuckers, left and right and then some
      „Pen is mightier than the sword". WHERE YOU GETTING YOUR PENS FROM?!
      Could you lend me some? We'll have plenty of fun
      Fuck guns and nunchucks, we'll be scribbling „REDRUM"
