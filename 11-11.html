      <b>[Verse 1]</b>
      Running from the fame
      In a rented Beemer, 140 in the rain
      I remember I was hoping for a change
      Funny how I really don't want it, once it came
      Paparazzi on a lookout
      Come on, little baby, look proud
      By the way though she hates being called a model
      That ain't fair, cause she's only into books now
      We fucked around and made a new sound (goddamn)
      Fucked around, made the news howl, goddamn
      Fucked around, made a few stacks, goddamn
      I fucked around I got the blues now
      I'm staying in Brussels and London now
      And only my real people come around
      The people that I'm leaving in the past
      Keep calling to lend them a couple thou', huh
      
      <b>[Chorus]</b>
      I don't like that
      I don't really like that
      I remember messaging my idols
      Hoping that they write back
      But they never write back
      Why they never write back?
      (Why they never write back?)
      I remember teasing my demons
      Hoping that they bite back, argh!
      I don't like that
      I don't really like that
      Now I got these kids in my DMs (DMs)
      Begging me to write back (uh huh)
      I don't write back (I don't write back)
      Why I never write back? (why I never write back?)
      I remember messaging my heroes (heroes)
      Feeling like a psychopath
      
      <b>[Verse 2]</b>
      Now this is the season for fox huntin'
      And they will not stop til they got somethin'
      This relationship got their heart jumpin'
      I'll say it now, make sure I'm not mumblin'
      I'm in love with her
      There you go, put it in your article
      I just fell in love, doesn't mean that I'm a fool
      They've been, uh, turning love into a carnival
      They've been, uh, wondering if I'm honorable
      Listen up though, here's the thing
      I only care what my momma and my sister think
      Fuck going online, that ain't part of my day
      And they been lying non stop, so you'd click the link
      
      <b>[Chorus]</b>
      I don't like that (hey, hey)
      I don't really like that (hey, hey)
      I remember messaging my idols
      Hoping that they write back
      But they never write back
      Why they never write back?
      (Why they never write back?)
      I remember teasing my demons
      Hoping that they bite back, argh!
      I don't like that
      I don't really like that
      Now I got these kids in my DMs (DMs)
      Begging me to write back (uh huh)
      I don't write back (I don't write back)
      Why I never write back? (why I never write back?)
      I remember messaging my heroes (heroes)
      Feeling like a psychopath

      <b>[Outro: Cold War, dir. Paweł Pawlikowski]</b>
      “- Pan uciekł, pan nas zdradził, pan nas oczernił. 
      Pan zostawił młodzież, młodych ludzi, którzy panu zaufali. 
      Pan Polski nie kocha
      - Kocham
      - Nie kocha Pan.”
