      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      Keep your guns, keep your cuffs, keep your laws off me
      It's enough, all of your thoughts are just lost on me
      So keep your monkey suits, keep your monkey paws off me
      They try to keep me in the dark, it just dawned on me
      Tell your queens, tell your kings, keep their pawns off me
      They try to waltz on my scene, blame their faults on me
      But I'm a shark, sardines, keep those jaws off me
      My inner McNulty's trying to breathe, you're throwing Rawls on me (Oh)
      The world's a sewer, keep your shit off me
      But what to do, when my heroes fucking spit on me
      Everybody is a Yoda, they just piss me off
      They think they're wise, all they fucking do is sit on me
      Keep the God, King, Pope, keep the state off me
      And before you take me on, what's your take on me?
      You think I'm a beast? Keep the wooden stakes off me
      I'm not the devil, man, I'm goddamn lovely
      Stop bugging me
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      Off and on, on, on
      Off, on and off, off, off, off
      On and off, off, off
      On, off and on, on, on, on

      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Off and on, and on and off
      You've got rhymes coming my way, you better call them off
      Or you'll find out my words aren't horribly soft
      Hitting your chest, asbestos, you're going to cough
      And do you motherfucking realize what it's going to cost?
      You're getting lost in the words I'm getting across
      And I know, losing one's mind is a hell of a lose
      At least your thoughts will be lighter when you're bearing the cross
      Me and the mic's like Calvin and Hobbes
      You better shut your ugly mugs and allow me to talk
      From the top of my lungs, speaking loudly enough
      Holding my balls while I'm at it, speaking proudly and blunt
      'Cause all you, cowardly fucks and you powerless cunts
      I want to season you in salt and devour you fucks
      You've got like a 24 hours, then I Bauer you up
      The best flow you've heard this minute, year, or a month
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      Off and on, on, on
      Off, on and off, off, off, off
      On and off, off, off
      On, off and on, on, on, on
      Off and on, on, on
      Off, on and off, off, off, off
      On and off, off, off
      On, off and on, on, on, on
