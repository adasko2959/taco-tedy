      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I'm a fucking walking normal man
      Drinking orange Fanta straight out of a soda can
      I'm a big time Yoga fan. Summer vacation
      Making plans to go to France, I might go to Japan
      To try to find and wine and dine Scarlett Johansson
      Try to be wise, I quote Quran
      Fuck Jay Leno, gotta double fucking name, it's Conan Stan
      My style is boring, cause my goals are bland
      Fuck rock, I'm a hip hop, and boulder fan
      I stood still when you posers ran
      He grip the microphone with both his hands
      Just like a shotgun in the hands of an older man
      When he becomes irrelevant just like a postage stamp
      Their style is cheesy, while I'm mostly ham
      I put you fucks in a truck, you can call me Stan
      You like the bible, I'm a Moses fan!
      I'm burning trees, hearing voices chant (Hi Rihanna), oh
      Fingerbang her with Royce's hand
      Cause I'm a man, all you boys be damned, fuck your ploys and plans
      Clark Kents change clothes and run
      While I relax, put my Kryptonite in Lois' bum, fun
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      What a pity, I'm walking through the city
      Fuck me, no one's even half pretty, ugh
      I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
      I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh
      What a pity, I'm walking through the city
      Fuck me, no one's even half pretty, ugh
      I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
      I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      I'm from Warsaw where nobody foresaw
      We'd be fucked in a war when power divorced law
      I shower in blood and call it a gore SPA
      Mom is asking if Im still doing the rap thing, of course, Ma
      No one called thus far, guess they think I'm subpar
      Not at the studio, but at another pub crawl
      Don't blame me, it's your fucking Lord's fault
      „No it's not". I guess I found your sore spot
      Write rhymes, eyes bleeding with ink, I'm Rorschach
      I'm not into fucking preachy rap-talk, so fuck Pac
      Call up mister Walt White, just wait for my door knock
      Crack a beer open, not smoking opium or rock
      I'm not Mr. Horrorcore. I'm Mr. Voldemort in Baltimore
      I'm giving you the war you've been hoping for
      Fighting with Omar behind Walmart, of course it's raw
      And if you're getting dizzy cause all the blood? You should focus more
      Not the kind of vocal that folks ignore
      Room shakes when I open the vocal chord
      I'm screaming fuck the Vatican 'till the pope is sore
      Gives me my cash back, greener than the fucking Hulk and Bulbasaur
      Point me to the smorgasbord, I'm get eat like an animal
      Like I don't know what these forks is for
      Each line is a Horcrux, boy
      And each time, I gotta remind you I give no fucks, boy
