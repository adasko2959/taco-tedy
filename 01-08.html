      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I'm not like hov
      I've never been hustling big
      I'm not the bossman, I know that I'm not running this ship
      I'm just a small fish who is having its fun in the sea
      Black Adder of rap, ain't no one is cunning as me
      Go run and see got knights that are gunning at me
      In addition the dictionary people coming for me
      Breaking the language, as sweet as a geeky woman could be
      The flow's magic, don't panic though
      Houdini's got nothing on me
      Nine bars and I am having my fun
      Don't want to bragging my son, but I'm smarter than them
      If you're listening, wondering where this banter is from
      I'm from Poland, motherfucker, call it land of the strong
      Do a lightbulb joke, I'll shove it up in your ass
      And you'll be asking
      How the fuck this Pollack done it so fast
      Slick like the Genie, fly like a Alladin's rug
      A barbarian coming through
      All you palladins duck
      You're
      All out of luck, 'cause I don't plan to give up
      Until I'm gold-pantie-rich, call me Kylie Minouge
      But for now, I'm just some regular paranoid bloke
      Doing voice-crimes, they should have my larynx revoked
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Yes, I know I was bragging again
      It's in the essence of hiphop, so it's hardly a sin
      Just so you know: if you're think about harming me, friend
      I'll form my motherfucking syllables to armies and win
      Everybody's screwing each other, like the monogamy's dead
      I saw my nemesis and said: Dude, aren't we friends?
      Fuck ya'll too, I'm not saying sorry again
      Your lives fueled with fake smiles, bunch of Barbies and Kens
      Alright, so I exaggerated a bit
      But all you haters should be smacked, feel the pain in your lip
      To any folks out there, who may hate me to bits
      You goota know the doctor said I'm crazy as shit
      I'm gonna brainstorm now, it should be raining a bit
      So you better keep yor cats at home, lady I am sick
      I'm infected with drums, hear the snare and the kick
      You can't learn rhythm, dummy, you inherit the shit (Rrrrah)
      Hear the kick and the snare
      And all other percussions that's are filling different layers
      Listen to kicking and clicking and throw your fists in the air
      The revolution's coming and we'll be there in the bit
      I'm word twisting 'Till it hurts to listen
      I curse when I'm spitting, fucking sharing my wit
      Matter of fact, gimmie the throne, the rest I'll have:
      Some nice tunes , gin&tonic and an the xbox pad
      The beat drops

      <b>[Zwrotka 3]</b>
      Bitchslap him again. You all thought
      The kid's gone, the kid is rapping again
      Rap considered to be Gone, now it's Back with the Wind
      That he produces with his lips, when he actually spits
      He's such a kid, he's got pedophiles kiddnaping him
      In a previous life he might've been Eminem
      Before his soul died when Ritalin kicked in
      And destroyed the legendary Shady villain in him (Rrrrah)
      FV, watch him killing the men
      Responsible for hip-hops's overfilling with trends
      You motherfuckers raped the muses, now you're stealing from them
      If you don't like him then, suck all the vanilla from him
      And nobody's ever interfering with him
      You better start the fucking cheering, when you're nearing on him
      And be giving him six beers, better do it quickly
      Because the third-person talking is fatiguing to him
      Rrrrah
