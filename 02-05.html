      <b>[Intro]</b>
      Aha, ha, ha, he, you gotta wait for me?
      You gotta... You gotta... Go... Go... Gotta wait for me? Yeap
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I'm the whitest black man, I'm the blackest white man
      I'm inhaling grey smoke, it's chocking my lifespan
      Red wine in my left, cigar in my right hand
      Grab my chest. My heart's a jungle with ripe land
      Watch him fight back. Leave them flabbergasted
      Leaving green phlegm in your favorite rapper's casket
      You know it's fantastic. Spit on the crowd. (That's sick)
      The raised hands make me mad, you got a question then ask it
      Greedy narcissists; see them leaning now
      Push them over the edge of the bank so I can see them drown
      Spray my bitter seed right out the window, see my semen frown
      Neighbours up my ass: „pal, you think you could keep it down?"
      I don't know how. I'm just being weird, not being loud
      And there's no way I can think of that I could tone the shit down
      But fuck that, I'll do my best, not a peep or a sound
      I make a serious face, tell the grim reaper „not now", fuck
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      „All my life I've been considered as the worst
      Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse"
      All my life i've been considered as a golden child
      Mind is broken now, I try to tone it down, I don't know how
      „All my life I've been considered as the worst
      Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse"
      One of those occasions when a gift is a curse
      „All my life I've been considered as the worst."
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Nah, that ain't true. I'm a good boy
      I want a tattoo cause Rihanna's fucking them rude boys
      I'm going crazy on these fucking beats, like a Shrute boy
      I'm inside her in a trojan, being like „what it do, troy"
      She grabbed my heart and called it a cute toy
      Karma hit me like DJ Khaled fathering a mute boy
      Saying that shit was a true joy
      Though I'm not sure if what I'm fucking saying's a true story
      Anyway. When you're making my tombstone
      Just write „here lies a boy, hella young but too grown
      And every drop of wine he vomited was a new poem
      But he flushed the fucking toilet every fucking time, cause it looked wrong"
      I'm a heartbreaker. It's very true, I can hook you up with hard data
      I'm part real, part faker, Me&mic, pepper/salt-shaker
      Escape first, read the charge later. They said I'm:
      „Kinda faggy with the artistry". Told them I agree
      But they didn't like the honesty. I said I'm fucking real
      I've seen gods die and goddesses bleed
      I've seen the devil dancing tango on the tallest of trees
      Exactly, It's beautiful but it's not pretty
      I'm gonna be a dumb fuck with a college degree
      So look at me, doing ballet with led in my bones
      And then I'm bumping oldies off my cellular phone, whoa
