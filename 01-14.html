      <b>[Intro]</b>
      - Have you been drinking?
      - The whole country is drinking!
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I need:
      Wings to fly and boots to march
      Something for my lingering eye when it moves too much
      I need my heart and my gut to move past the rut
      And start talking again to decide on whom to touch
      And whom to stay away from
      Whom to trust whom to love and care for and whom to fuck (RRRAH)
      I need some booze to glug
      After which i thunder-shower
      You acoustic fucks, like I'm Zeus
      I start sucking on the cigarette butt
      But the smoke - it isn't bitter and intrusive enough
      Take a snooze, 'cause half-asleep, is lucid enough
      So let's go out to do the sickest and the stupidest stuff
      The weather's pretty pleasant
      I'm feeling like a legend
      I represent intelligence
      You represent the peasents
      I'm spitting from a mountain
      You're spitting from a terrace
      It's just my stuff is better and you're probably getting jealous (HA)
      I hope you're getting bitter (HA)
      And posting on your twitter (HA)
      „Look at this wigga spitting slicker than a lot of" nnnnNNNAH
      I guess you're meaning black men
      I've got the sickest raps
      And your flow is barely sitting up
      I've got mine doing backflips, uh
      
      <b>[Refren]</b>
      I need some booze to glug
      I need some booze to glug
      Ey yo Steve, I need some booze to glug
      Always sip a lovely wine, never glug it
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Ha, sicker than your average
      Watch me take a sip of liquor quick
      Then I'm spilling the madness
      You're talking in a primitive language
      This is why your mother's frowning
      She is really embarressed
      You're pretending to be smart
      But you're silly and savage
      So I make you obsolete
      Just like Ritalin did to parents
      Suburban thugs, you all live in a palace
      All you Papa Docs suck 'cause your middle name's Clarence
      Just hear me preach, like you'd listen to Malice
      All these words, they confuse me end up twisting my larynax
      I'm misunderstood, like an intelligent actress
      Stop talking, show your tits, ma'am, you're very attractive
      Getting mindfucked's a terrible habit
      Make a hole in my brain that's where I bury my past, damn it
      My insanity's batshit
      I'm black at it
      With that Slyrethin rap, man
      It's black magic
      Though I'm white and uptight and asthmatic
      My words are motherfucking asteroids, I stab planets, like daggers
      Holding my blood's a task
      Adequate for the Atlantic
      But I'll pollute it with my bad habits
      Am I a killer? Fucking ask GLADoS
      And how does all of it work? Fucking ask magnets
      But can a whitey be a rapper? Fucking ask Mathers
      I do not care and fuck you if you think that crap matters, uh

      <b>[Refren]</b>
      I need some booze to glug
      I need some booze to glug
      Ey yo Ricky, I need some booze to glug
      You get...
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 3]</b>
      Fuck partying, I'm having visions
      Most of them are so illegal I'll be fiddled by a man in prison
      Still less awkward than when parents visit
      All you should be hearing is like fucking ******
      'Cause I'm that explicit
      Step back, fuckers, the man is spitting
      Didn't they teach you: „leave the room when the motherfucking cat is hissing"?
      Cal 911, 'cause your talents' missing
      And you've got less to say than motherfucking Maggie Simpson
      And, uhm...
      Henry Pollard, Are we having fun yet?
      Got Murdoch saying:
      „Damn, son, have we tapped his phone yet?"
      Both kinda sweet and kinda creepy like phone threats
      Me and my brain afraid of deaths, so we haven't grown yet
      I'm kinda lonely, but at least got some ghost friends
      Hanging with ba-ba-ba-Billy the Kid and the whole set
      Drop a bomb where my foes gather
      And end the day with getting hammered right at Moe's Tavern
      I do not follow most patterns
      I'm post-race, post-sex, post-trends and I'm post-manners
      I swear to god my brain is so scattered
      I'm screaming „Bring the 90's back" wearing a gross flannel (Oh)

      <b>[Refren]</b>
      I need some booze to glug
      I need some booze to glug
      Ey yo Barry, I need some booze to glug
      Can we stop saying love?
