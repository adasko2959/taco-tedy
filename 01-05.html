      <b>[Intro]</b>
      My father told me to never get old. I should have listened to him
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 1]</b>
      I was such a pretty child, mother, what happened?
      Not that much of steady sleep far too much napping
      Now my healthy skin's been replaced by rough patches
      And my medicine isn't syrup and it's not aspirin, it's drugs
      I never quit, can't be done rapping
      It's fun, but will I gather any funds rapping?
      You cunts told me to sack it, but I won't have it
      And you rubbish rappers need to vanish leave the pros at it
      'Cause the way you flow's scandalous
      Not in a good way, I hate it when you vandals spit
      And no matter what your language is
      It's all gibberish, somebody should go ban your lips
      How does it not compromise with your Grammy wins?
      You should mix some heavy liquor with Prozac and quit
      I'll paint a picture, so go stand and witness
      The most handsome wizard of flows, chants his scriptures
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      I'm sorry mama, but the bones they're not listening
      (A a a o, o, a a a o, o, a a a o)
      And though I told them twice to stop, they just keep growing
      (A a a o, o, a a a o)
      And I was such a pretty child look at this picture of me
      (A a a o, o, a a a o, o, a a a o)
      I'm sorry mama, but the bones, just keep growing
      
      <b>[Zwrotka 2]</b>
      Bold man, not a Modest Mouse
      I'd love to be the latter, but me and my guitar had a falling out
      Lotta problems to be loud about, should have started a band 
      that matters, throw the media garbage out
      But I couldn't be bothered to achieve that, 
      all I have is dreams, gotta tell you like it is, they're dark and mad
      Cat on the mic, dogs barking at me, while my rhymes evolving, 
      Charles Darwin's happy
      Seriously, It's no dissing, it's just a question
      It's about your flow, listen
      Was it mostly ghostwritten by the ghost of Walt Disney
      Or was it Casper? I'm asking cause your flow's sissy
      Now you're gasping, did you really think your flow's cripsy?
      You keep revolving around the same topic, flow-rotisserie (UGH)
      It's easier than it's going to seem
      Either you know it or you don't, there is no in-between
      So I flow like a meteor. Don't you know this?
      The other things are boring like the chores to cope with
      Hope to flow 'til I'm a hundred and four
      And I'll repeat it if you think that I was joking before
      I was such a pretty child. What the fuck happened?
      Used to hold a smile, now I'm throwing up acid
      Used to be a pretty child, now I'm pretty childish
      Had a pretty smile, really. Now I'm pretty wild, shit
      
      
      <b>[Hook]</b>
      I'm sorry mama, but the bones they're not listening
      (A a a o, o, a a a o, o, a a a o)
      And though I told them twice to stop, they just keep growing
      (A a a o, o, a a a o)
      And I was such a pretty child look at this picture of me
      (A a a o, o, a a a o, o, a a a o)
      I'm sorry mama, but the bones, just keep growing

      <b>[Outro]</b>
      I'd like to apologize profusely for using the word "flow" 
      8 times in 2 verses
      That's a lot
      Sorry about that
      And uhh, the title does look a bit weird doesn't it?
      "Such a pretty child", the pedophile anthem
